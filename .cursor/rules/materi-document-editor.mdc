# Materi Document Editor — Project Context

The full PRD lives at `docs/PRD.md`. Read it before making architectural decisions.

## Quick Reference

**What we're building:** A browser-based document editor with live A4 pagination, backed by an Express API with in-memory JSON persistence.

**Stack:** React + TipTap (frontend), Express (backend), TypeScript throughout.

**Core architecture (decoration approach):**
- Single TipTap editor instance — all native editing behaviour preserved.
- Layout engine is a **pure function**: reads DOM measurements, outputs `LayoutResult` (page breaks, text start positions, page count).
- Two-pass measurement: Pass 1 reads paragraph heights (batch `getBoundingClientRect`), Pass 2 reads line rects on boundary paragraphs only (`getClientRects`).
- Visual page breaks via TipTap Decoration API (`margin-top` on first paragraph of each new page) — decorations never enter the document model.
- Page frames and numbers rendered as absolutely positioned overlays outside TipTap's content flow.

**Layout constants** (centralised in a single file):

| Constant | Value |
|----------|-------|
| PAGE_WIDTH | 794px |
| PAGE_HEIGHT | 1123px |
| MARGIN_TOP | 96px |
| MARGIN_BOTTOM | 96px |
| MARGIN_LEFT | 96px |
| MARGIN_RIGHT | 96px |
| CONTENT_HEIGHT | 931px |

## Key Constraints

- **Determinism over features.** Prioritise correctness and testability.
- **Document model is source of truth.** Decorations/overlays are visual-only. `getJSON()` round-trips cleanly.
- **Bounded reflow.** Remeasure from the dirty paragraph onwards, not the full document.
- **Gate on `document.fonts.ready`** before the first layout pass.
- **No secrets.** Zero paid API keys required to run.
- **Single-command startup.** `npm install && npm run dev` must work on a clean machine.

## V1 Page Break Behaviour

Paragraph-level pushing only — if a paragraph doesn't fit, the entire paragraph moves to the next page. No mid-paragraph splits in V1.

## Edit Cycle

```
User types → TipTap updates DOM → debounce 100–150ms → Pass 1 (paragraph heights) → Pass 2 (line rects on boundary paragraphs) → LayoutResult → decorations + overlays update
```

## API

- `POST /documents` — save document, returns `{ id }`. Server sets timestamps.
- `GET /documents/:id` — returns `{ id, title, content, created_at, updated_at }`.
- In-memory storage; does not survive server restart.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Type text, see page boundaries and numbers.
2. Create 3+ pages with reflow.
3. Save → refresh → Load by ID → identical content structure and pagination.
4. No runtime console errors during typical usage.

## Out of Scope (V1)

Mid-paragraph splitting, rich text formatting, images/tables, collaboration, auth, print/export, mobile.
